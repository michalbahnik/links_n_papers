  * Open-source speech-to-text engine by Mozzila.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Sanghyun_Woo_Convolutional_Block_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)
  * Spatial and channel feature attention blocks added to improve convolutions by focusing on features.
  
### Miscellaneous

* [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks (Zeiler, Fergus)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)
  * Novel article on visualisation CNN's feature layers in order to get deeper understanding.
* [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf)
  * Model destillation and ensembelling to improve performance.
* [Revisiting ResNets: Improved Training and Scaling Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07579)
  * Applying new training methods to old networks (ResNet) for baseline methods use.
* [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?context=cs)
  * Effective training of very deep neural networks.
