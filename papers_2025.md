# Papers in 2025

These papers cought my attention in year 2025:

* [YOLOE: Real-Time Seeing Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07465v1)
  * Efficient, unified, and open object detection and segmentation model with zero inference and transferring overhead compared with closed-set YOLOs.
* [Transformers without Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622v1)
  * Dynamic Tanh: Drop-in replacement for normalisation layer in transformers with matching or exceeding performance.
* [FoundationStereo: Zero-Shot Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09898)
  * Strong zero-shot stereo matching foundation model. 
* [SuperARC: A Test for General and Super Intelligence Based on First Principles of Recursion Theory and Algorithmic Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16743)
  * Good introduction to measuring "intelligence" of AI, introduces test challenges using metrics based on model abstraction and optimal Bayesian inference, not just compression.
